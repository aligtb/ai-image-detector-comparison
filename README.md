# 🧠 Comparative Evaluation of AI-Generated Image Detectors

Welcome to our group project for *Programming for Modern Machine Learning*.  
This project compares different AI-generated image detectors to evaluate their **accuracy**, **robustness**, and **industry applicability**.

---

## 📌 Project Goal

Compare multiple image detection tools on real vs. AI-generated images to understand:
- How well they detect synthetic content
- Which models are most robust under compression/noise
- Real-world readiness of each method
