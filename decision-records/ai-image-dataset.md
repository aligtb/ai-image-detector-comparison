# AI/Real Image Datasets
1. [CIFAKE: Real and AI-Generated Synthetic Images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/birdy654/cifake-real-and-ai-generated-synthetic-images)
      - 60k real and 60k ai images
     - Broad image categories we could choose (e.g., a lot of vehicles and animals are present in the dataset)
     - MIT License
2. [AI vs. Human Generated Images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessandrasala79/ai-vs-human-generated-dataset)
     - ~ 80k files 50/50 split
     - Even broader categories (might be hard to categorize)
3. [AI Generated Images vs Real Images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cashbowman/ai-generated-images-vs-real-images)
     - 975 Files, Focus on people, animals, and art
     - Probably least suitable
  
## Conclusion
I think CIFAKE would be the best fit for our project
